            To join a Workspace, you will need an invitation from your
            homeschool community manager. Please contact your Homeschool Admin
            and provide them with your email address so they can add you to the
            right Workspace.

            If you are unsure who your Homeschool Admin is, check with your
            parent or guardianâ€”they should have the information you need!
